# MIPBarModel

This is supporting information for the paper "Why aphid virus retention needs more attention: modelling aphid behaviour and virus manipulation in non-persistent plant virus transmission" by Falla and Cunniffe.

The code Example.R recreates Fig 4A in the paper, showing how all three models in the paper - the MIP model, the BAR model, and the new MIPBAR model - can be solved numerically, and giving a default parameterisation for all three models.
